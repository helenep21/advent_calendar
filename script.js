  1: `Welcome to December ! üéÑ<br>
  Up until a few months ago, it wasn't one of my favorite month.<br>
  But now, it has become really special to me because it's the birth month of my favorite person :)<br>
  <br>
  Since I know your love of advent calendar, this is my version of one !<br>
  Every day, you will get find out one thing I love about you (it's not in a preference order)<br>
  <br>
  ‚ù§ I love you very much ‚ù§<br>
  <br>
  Today's pick is how much you expand my world. Since I met you, I've discovered<br>
  new shows, new books, new artists, new knowledge, and most of all I keep discovering new<br>
  reasons to love and admire you !<br>
  So, much like the universe, my love for you seems to expand infinitely (it's science yes!)
  `,
  2: `Second day of the month, second thing I love about you !<br>
  I love how beautiful, pretty, cute, stunning, hot, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS you are !!<br>
  I don't mean that in a superficial way, I mean it in what you would call a holistical way<br>
  (still not sure of what it means lol)<br>
  From the moment you wake up, with your hair all tousled and sleepy eyes,<br>
  to getting dressed ready for your day,<br>
  at work in your little blue vest,<br>
  on a date (with me, duh) in a fancy outfit,<br>
  to back in bed tucked in for a goodnight's sleep,<br>
  you're always the most fascinating thing to look at in any room.<br>
  I will never get tired of looking at you, barely listening to what you're saying<br>
  because i'm getting distracted by how pretty you are ‚ù§<br>`,
  3: `I hope you're enjoying this little advent calendar so far my girl !<br>
  Today's reason to love you is : your resilience.<br>
  I'm always quite in awe of how you manage to deal with everything that is thrown your way,<br>
  big or small, you stay the little ray of sunshine in everyone's life and I find that incredibly beautiful.<br>
  Even when times get a little hard, you always find your way through.<br>
  I know you sometimes have a lot going on, but it's important that you remember the following : <br>
  - you've done a lot of hard things already<br>
  - you've always recovered from any difficulty<br>
  - you always have people you can lean on<br>
  and now you'll also always have me to figure things out !<br>
  You're my tough girl, and I'm  beyong proud of you ‚ù§<br>`,
