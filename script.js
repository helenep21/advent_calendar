  1: `Welcome to December ! üéÑ<br>
  Up until a few months ago, it wasn't one of my favorite month.<br>
  But now, it has become really special to me because it's the birth month of my favorite person :)<br>
  <br>
  Since I know your love of advent calendar, this is my version of one !<br>
  Every day, you will get find out one thing I love about you (it's not in a preference order)<br>
  <br>
  ‚ù§ I love you very much ‚ù§<br>
  <br>
  Today's pick is how much you expand my world. Since I met you, I've discovered<br>
  new shows, new books, new artists, new knowledge, and most of all I keep discovering new<br>
  reasons to love and admire you !<br>
  So, much like the universe, my love for you seems to expand infinitely (it's science yes!)
